This is kafka implementation of the SDQC system.

Run kafka_consumer_misinformation.py TOPIC1 TOPIC2 TRAININGDATAPATH MODELPATH to read jsons from TOPIC1 and output resulting jsons to TOPIC2.

Other scripts kafka_consumer_echo.py and kafka_producer_inputjsons.py are for debugging and probably will not be useful. 
python kafka_producer_inputjsons.py TOPIC1 loads jsons from standard input and sends them to TOPIC1.
python kafka_consumer_echo.py TOPIC2 loads jsons from TOPIC2 and print them.
